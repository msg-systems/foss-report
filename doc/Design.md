FOSS Report Design
==================


Requirements
------------

The FOSS Report tool should aggregate the artifact and license information of the repositories of a project.
It should provide a consolidated view of this information for the whole project.
This view should be provided in different human and machine readable formats.
The ouput should be written to the file system or to the console for further processing.

The FOSS Report tool should read the Thirdparty.txt files generated by the Apache Maven license plugin.
The file output should be readable again with the FOSS report tool, to provide a diff between two different versions.

The FOSS Report tool may be enhanced to read the artifact and license information of other build tools (e.g. pip-license for python).

The FOSS Report tool shall not implement some transitive dependency resolution on the build files (e.g. pom.xml) itself, but leverage the reports generated by the build tools.
